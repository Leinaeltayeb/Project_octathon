Project Aim: This Project considers cardiology patients stuck in places with minimal medical access in Sudan like omdurman algezira etc. With the aid of a wearable medical device, the project aims to deliver a framework which processes ecg readings to provide notices/assess the level of urgency a patient requires at the pre-diagnostic stage.
